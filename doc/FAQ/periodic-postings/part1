Many newsgroups contain articles which are posted on a periodic basis.
These articles tend to be useful for both novice and experienced
users, as they usually fall into one of these categories:

    1. How-to articles explaining some of the basics and fine
    points of network usage, etiquette, standards, etc.

    2. Introductory notes about one or more newsgroups, covering
    policies (if any) for submissions to that group, usage, etc.
    Common questions and answers pertinent to a newsgroup(s).

    3. Indexes of archives, or pointers to archives for various
    groups.  Periodic newsletters, calendars, pointers to
    publications.

    4. Statistical information and reports about Usenet; tables of
    Usenet hosts, links, etc.

    5. Miscellany, including small useful sources, "fun" lists, and so
    on.

This is a list of the periodic postings known at this time; each
posting is listed in an entry that includes who posts the article,
which newsgroup(s) it appears in, what Subject is used, and how often
the article is posted.  The list is sorted by Newsgroups and Subject
information.  The character '*' is used as a wildcard, e.g. "v*INF1"
matches "v01INF1", "v02INF1", etc.

The Date in a posting's entry indicates, where given, when the
posting last appeared.  However, it may be inaccurate if (a) the
maintainer of the posting has changed the Subject line, or (b) the
most recent version has not reached my site, or (c) the entry actually
corresponds to multiple postings because of wildcarding.

The Archive-name, where present, indicates the archive name that
appeared in the posting when it was last posted.  Note that if one
entry matches multiple postings because of wildcarding, then only one
archive name will appear.  Similarly, the Summary indicates the
summary that appeared.

Corrections and additions (via MAIL) are most welcome.  New entries
for the list should be submitted in the same form as the entries
below, with From, Newsgroups, Subject, Frequency, and (optionally)
Comments lines, in that order.

Several archives of USENET periodic informational postings exist.  To
find out more about them and how to access them, see the posting
entitled "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" in the
news.answers newsgroup.  If you do not know how to get that newsgroup
and/or your site does not receive it and/or that article has expired
in it, you can retrieve it via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu
[18.70.0.209] in /pub/usenet/news.answers/news-answers/introduction.
If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by
sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the command
"send usenet/news.answers/news-answers/introduction" in the message.
